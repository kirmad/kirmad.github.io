“*I have fallen in love with a french girl…! How’d I propose to her…? Yes, the thought of just kissing her the french way and doing away with it crossed my mind… but…!*” – believe me… this was not my reason to start learning new languages…! Aaah… how I wish it were…!

This series of posts would be about my experimentation with foreign languages.

I had started learning French recently – I liked it so much that I started learning Japanese along with it…! It’s quite interesting and sometimes funny to learn different language. I couldn’t think of learning Spanish, cause it is also a Latin based language… and I knew *sukochi* (little in japanese) japanese already… so thought why not get better at it…!

So, currently, I spend around 1 hour a day to learn both French and Japanese… I am finding a lot of interesting things and I want to blog them in as I learn – also would help me in memorizing them and as a bonus, I’ll get the habit of writing blogs…!!!

Phew, that’s a long explanation…!

The first thing I learnt in both the languages is the “hypothetical” situation –

*If I meet a girl in the country, how do I start the conversation.* (well, like I mentioned earlier, I have to prepare for the best :D)

I am learning the spoken language, and I have pretty much left the reading and writing part… (the spellings are just too complex in French and a bit too many Kanjis in Japanese). The best part is I am learning the languages in the regional accent which makes it quite fun to learn.

Couple of observations:

*Japanese is “cute”* – or to say in japanese… Kawaiii! See, it has a cute way of saying cute too! For some reason, the words are just fun to use for me.

*French is spoken in a hurry* – well, come on, if you go by the way they write Mademoiselle (literally means, my little lady – if you call someone that in English, I may not like the response) and by the way they speak it, I feel like writing it mdmsllll! So it is with a number of other words I have learnt :).

*English is not spoken as “English” in either (any other) of the languages –* French call it anglai*se* (se is pretty much silent)… further more, when you use it in a sentance, it is **la**anglai*se* or “the English”… all the language names are preceded with “the”. In Japanese, it’s Aego… and if you use it in a sentance, it’s Aegoga :). Come to think of it, it is the case in my regional languages to – Angrezi in Hindi and Aanglamu in Telugu. I wonder why names get changed to this extent in different languages.

The fact is learning new languages is a lot of fun and pretty interesting… I am really loving it… Will keep adding new posts to this series as I learn more… Have a lot more to write, but for another day 🙂

*Bonjure mes amis* 🙂
