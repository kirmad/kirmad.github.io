Eyes are the portal to look into one’s heart. But, I have always wondered – “how do (you feel that) all the emotions show up in the eyes” – it is fascinating how our mind works :).

For me, the best part of drawing a portrait is bringing out the emotions I see in the photograph. I was sketching Jo’s photo and the expression was very subtle. I wanted to work through the basics before I try to bring out the emotions.

Initially, when I started, I could see an element of apprehension in the picture. It showed in the girl’s eyes. And all I did was to add a very small stroke to make it the pleasant curiosity I wanted to depict.

Check this – the eyes speak everything even in this pic, but the true expression came out from that little stroke of charcoal I had in the left side of the lips :). I was truly amazed myself.

I did not do any touch-up work for the eyes, but they felt totally different now.

How the smallest strokes, and the little decisions we take change the way things are is quite amusing. I think I will learn more in the path I am taking.
