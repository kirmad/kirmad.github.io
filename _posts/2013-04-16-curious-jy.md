This is a charcoal sketch of our ‚Äúgod-daughter‚Äù Jo :D‚Ä¶! It was done on cold pressed paper (my first attempt at it‚Ä¶)

I wanted to capture the subtle pleasant curiosity she had in her eyes and facial expression‚Ä¶! Hope I justified it‚Ä¶ :)‚Ä¶! This is incomplete, hope I‚Äôll finish it soon üòÄ
