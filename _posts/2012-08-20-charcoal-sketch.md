Charcoal sketch :). It was fun to work with charcoal :). The depth and effect you can bring with charcoal is just brilliant. Will have to experiment more.

My mom wasn’t impressed with the first sketch – apparently I made it too dark, which was just as the photo was. I was asked to be creative and get to the lighter side – I hope I justified that in my second sketch :).
