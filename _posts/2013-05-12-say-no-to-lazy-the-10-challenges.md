*This is a post for myself. Perhaps what I would write in my diary, if I had one :).*

All of my friends know how lazy I am. Damn, I even got that on the slogan on my blog‚Ä¶! I have always felt laziness is essential for a programmer ‚Äì ah, I derived that from what my teacher (Koti) once said ‚Äúarrogance is important for a mathematician‚Äù.

The other day, I was thinking ‚Äì looking back at everything I did, every thing I planned and I had this realization hit me hard ‚Äì there were a lot of things I left unfinished. The list started from unsent drafts to unimplemented ideas. I guess I was smart enough to realize my laziness has actually started pulling me down. It had to go. Why was I lazy, I thought ‚Äì a lot of times, it was not truly because I was lazy, it was because of a quality I had ‚Äì I hate to do boring stuff :P‚Ä¶ So, whenever I hit a boring task, I just stopped working on it and started something else‚Ä¶ this was what happened in most of the cases. The other reason was randomization ‚Äì I am good at organizing stuff‚Ä¶ but too lazy to organize them myself‚Ä¶ often I started new things which were more interesting and left the old ones incomplete‚Ä¶ üôÅ

I have to fix this ‚Äì going forward, I have to learn a lot of new things ‚Äì being lazy will definitely become a hindrance and I know randomization will hit me hard.

This change is not going to be easy, so, I am challenging myself to fix some of these:

Phase 1:

- Look back at things unfinished and bring them to a *logical conclusion*; There are a lot of things I need to close down on ‚Äì the first order of business is to finish them off or at least bring them to a status where I can hand it over to someone else to finish. No back logs. Make a list of what I need to finish and their priorities, have deadlines and no matter what, stick to them.
- No more procrastination, no wastage of time; half of my time, I am just lazing around doing nothing ‚Äì watching some series or playing some game. I know I can work even while doing that, I need to utilize my time to the best. This phase of my life is perhaps the most important one, I should not waste a moment of it ‚Äì it‚Äôs gonna be tough, but it would definitely be worth it :). Organize things better. It takes just a few minutes to organize your thoughts and work. But it saves a lot of time later on.

Phase 2:

It is important to train myself both physically and mentally. I have used my back pain as an excuse to be lazy ‚Äì I have to be stronger than ever. So, it‚Äôs time for an upgrade, got to build the muscle strength :). I am also facing issues with concentration, I used to be really good at focusing on things, I need to get that back. Now-a-days, a small distraction, and I am off by at least half an hour :P‚Ä¶!

For all this, I need to make a few new habits. They say ‚Äú*You can‚Äôt teach an old dog new tricks*‚Äú‚Ä¶ aah, I guess I am not that old to learn new things, but I do know there will be an resisting inertia. The key is to start slow and make sure I practice them without fail, so no point in being too ambitious ‚Äì be realistic and sustainable; if I can do better, great.

I am trying to put a conscious effort to learn new things, if I like them, I know I would not have to put any effort to continue them ‚Äì and I will continue the things I would really want to.

***This is where I need you guys, whenever you meet me, you can ask me if I am still on track, if I am not, I will treat you with all-you-can-have-fruit-juices :).***

The health ‚Äì

- Wake up by 05:00 ‚Äì practice Yoga and meditation for at least an hour; I think this is going to be one of the toughest. I wake up early, but I am usually in this state of ‚Äì *wake me up and I will kill you*‚Ä¶ this is the time I need to utilize the most of. The plan is to do Bhramari Pranayama for 2-3 minutes as soon as I wake up, and before I sleep. This improves concentration and calms your mind. Think about what my goal is and what I have done so far to achieve it for 5 minutes, think about my ikigai (‚Äúa reason to get up in the morning‚Äù; that is, a reason to enjoy life) ‚Äì this would help me to focus and stay positive. Then get out and do Yoga in fresh air ‚Äì not at home. At the end of the day, after dinner ‚Äì go for a walk ‚Äì think about things I have done, what I could have done better.
- Water intake; my work inherently comes with a lot of *profession-related health issues* :P‚Ä¶ yoga is good to make sure I maintain the right posture, but the other thing that comes with this is less intake of water and straining eyes. Getting up to get a glass of water every 30 minutes, would help a lot in both the cases.
- Try to have four different colored fruits a day; This was something my yoga instructor suggested in the class. I went ahead and tried to read up on this. Apparently, different colored fruits have different chemical properties that are quite beneficial. Orange ‚Äì beta-carotene; Red ‚Äì antioxidant; Purple/Black ‚Äì proanthocyanidins; Green ‚Äì lutein or zeaxanthin; And I love fruits, so why not :).

and everything else ‚Äì

- Learn something new every 2 weeks; Learning new things is a part of growing. I have a whole bunch of things I can learn ‚Äì how to whistle, a magic trick that would impress a kid, a new strategy in chess, a new chord on guitar, a new technique in painting, a nice dance step, (aah, and I have always wanted to have the flexibility to do a full split :)‚Ä¶). The best part is that the more you learn new things, the easier it becomes for you to learn more ‚Äì and that‚Äôs the whole point of this. However, there is a chance of me getting randomized because of this. I should look out for it. I may not be able to learn something big in the short duration, the point is to put some effort to learn a new thing, and make some progress. In the end of the day what matters is if I feel happy about what I have learnt. I need to be always on the edge in various fields. I have always wanted to involve all my friends in the company I start. For that, I need to understand their work better. When you start exploring into multiple fields, you learn to relate to things at a different level.
- Once in a week, write or talk to a friend about my thoughts, what I have done, what I have accomplished, what changed. Writing and expressing myself clearly is very important once I start *our* company.
- Read; I have gotten really bad at reading‚Ä¶ It is important to read at least one hour a day, one topic a day. Wake that inquisitive side of me‚Ä¶ ask questions, learn about it. This is also important to avoid randomization. Often when I have a question, I start digging deep into it and lose track of time ‚Äì this is something that causes loss of productivity. I need to manage time perhaps during travel to office for this. Things which take less than 10 minutes, do them as soon as you can. Queue the rest of them for later.
- Once a month, go out to some forum and meet people; it will help understand people better and make new contacts.
- Twice a year, go to an orphanage or old age home and meet people. Make them smile. This helps in appreciating life, well‚Ä¶ I would want to do this more frequent, but as I said, I do not want to make a commitment that I can‚Äôt keep up with. Better to under promise and over deliver, right :).
