<div class="figure">[![logo[1]](/assets/images/2012/09/logo1.png)](/assets/images/2012/09/logo1.png)</div><div class="figure">**Logo:** Nutty Labs</div>**Concept:** Forum for people who areâ€¦ uhmâ€¦ pleasantly nutsâ€¦ ðŸ˜‰

As the logo, I use overlapping acorns (the nut that scrat is always after in Ice Age) â€“ which reminds people of the craziness behind it.

Nutty labs is a forum for ideas which would seem nuts, crazy friends, and a whole lot of fun â€“ while we try to create things new.

**Time taken:** 10 min, 53 seconds â€“ yup, timed myself ðŸ˜‰
