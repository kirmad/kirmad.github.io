This post is mainly for Indians out there, or people who have friends in India. So, when it comes to mobile balance, you can definitely say that I’ll be the one with the least amount. Previously, I used to have negative balance on my mobile. Its better now. My current balance is 1ps. Funny thing is that the local SMS is just 2ps for me and I don’t have even that.

I am always on the net, so I use way2sms.com for the same. However, I don’t like people to know that I am using way2sms – well, people wont understand that I don’t have money and all… they think I am a miser :(. So, a month ago, I really got desperate and searched for bugs in the site which I can use to my advantage in order to remove their banner in the end.

I found one trick, which was caused due to improper handling of the message body.

<span>Now, whats this error? Well, I found out the SMS count size varies for different characters. It happens because in the new mobile phones (I don’t think it works with the really old models), the way the messages are saved and sent involves using an additional escape character in order to save the following symbols: \[ \] | { } ~ \\  
So, these seven symbols are considered of length TWO. Instead of length one. So, what do we do? Use 20 of these characters, and make the message size 140 – by adding spaces in the end. So, we find then that the mobile phone recognizes these 140 characters as if they were of size 160. So, the way2sms banner is not seen anymore!</span>

I wrote a small script for testing it – solely on educational purposes as a proof of concept. I am not responsible for any action(s) that may lead to any legal issues.

Use the signature as: ||||||||||||||||||||  
Select the checkbox – and presto – no banner!

Anyway, I strongly recommend using way2sms directly without anything of this sort. Its a great service and I am really thankful to its creators.
