This took me half a day. It is still incomplete, I took a break after I was done doing the basic stuff. This actually needs a little more work, but my friends liked it this way. So, keeping it so :).  
My main idea was to bring out the smile – loved it. I made a humble attempt to bring out the smile as beautiful as I saw it in the pic. Tell me how it came up :)…!
