> “Follow your brain and you’ll never be sad… but I’ve always wondered if it is worth… you won’t find true happiness either… for me, it’s just a vast dry land.
> 
> Follow your heart… you may face a whole lot of sadness… but those few glimpses of true happiness, those little green pastures make the journey worthwhile…
> 
> When you look back in time, these little green pastures, turn out to become huge grasslands… great memories…”
