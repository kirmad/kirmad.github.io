> *Yet each man kills the thing he loves By each let this be heard, Some do it with a bitter look, Some with a flattering word, The coward does it with a kiss, The brave man with a sword!*

<span> â€”</span> *The Ballad Of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde*

Oscar Wilde is one of my favorite poets. Sometimes though, I do not wish to agree with him. But is it true? I leave the decision to you.
