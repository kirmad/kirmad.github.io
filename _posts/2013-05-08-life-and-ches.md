> <div dir="ltr" id=":zl">The goal in chess is to check mate, but quite often we rage to kill the opponents pieces, hence lose the purpose. Life is similar, though a bit longer. It is important to keep sight of the goal to make suitable moves. It is easy to lose sight of long term rewards while cherishing immediate returns.</div>
