> Life is too short to do everything yourself… sometimes, you need to rely on your friends :)… And hey, if you are sure you can do it, where’s the challenge in doing it? Do what you’d love to do. Work on things that challenge you and help you grow… outsource the rest :).

I was asked this a couple of times – “*you can do it yourself, then why don’t you?*“… Well, this is my answer…

Don’t try to do everything by yourself just because you can. It is really important to know when to take help :).
