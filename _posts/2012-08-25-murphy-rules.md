More often than not, things do not happen your way. This reminds me of one such days…! A friend once told me, you can do anything if you truly want it to happen. It kind of brought a bit of hope, but I have started doubting it now. When things come to screw you and when Murphy starts to rule, everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. And unfortunately, there is no escape :P.

Aaaw, I hate this post. It is soo depressing. Guys, I am not usually like this, but you know – some times, life leaves you no choice :P.

Well, this is not just a memory, it is a game changer if you may call it in my life. So, I think I have to keep it. Who said you should only keep the good memories huh?
