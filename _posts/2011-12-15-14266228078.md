A small 2 minute poem… was looking out of my bus window and found some birds, do not know why, but it just turned into a poem. I just wanted it to get out… I remember the days when I used to walk… think to myself, sing… sometimes things felt so beautiful that they translated to beautiful similes… never documented them. Never remembered them past that moment. I want to save them now, so here it is :)…

I am not great at Hindi, and so is this trial… I think poems are much more beautiful in Indian languages… I prefer developing my English to convey messages to a broader audience, but the sweetness of my regional languages can never be felt in it.

*“*  
*Gham ek parinda hai… Har jaha pe uska tikhana hai… tikta nahi kahi pe woh magar… bas khud se usse bhagaana hai…  
“*

Here, I compare the sorrow to a fleeting bird. The whole world is it’s place, and it is free to go anywhere and do anything… but one nice thing is, it never stays at a place, there is always a hope… all you need to do is shoo it yourself :).
