A draft for me is like a piece of paper on which you write things which mean a lot to you and just keep it locked in your closet… Each piece of paper is meant for someone… Perhaps, subconsciously, you wish for them to be seen by them… but you fear for what it might do…

Today, I was cleaning up my closet… I realized that most of my drafts were a note to myself… a reminder, a catharsis, a heartfelt wish which I couldn’t express… innumerable number of blog posts hidden to anyone… drafts in my mail subject to specific people, but never pressed the send button… I wondered, does everyone do this? I feel it is just human to express ourselves… sometimes, the emotions develop so much that you need to purge them… but when these emotions are strong, you fear them… You fear what result they may lead to… Is this just normal? I do not know. The truth is, as of this moment, I do not care.

These notes to myself are a way of cataloging my past, my emotions, and my ideas. These are not just drafts, they are a way for me to look into my past. Some to cherish the moments that had past, some to remind me of things I perhaps would have preferred to forget.

This post will not be a draft though.
