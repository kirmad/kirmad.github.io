This is a list of things I loveâ€¦ that just bring a smile on my face, always. Hopefully, this will keep on increasing :).

At the end of the day, all said and doneâ€¦ it is the small things in life that bring me true joy â€“ and this is my humble attempt to catalog them ðŸ™‚

1. *The first drop of rain*â€¦ when I am outside not expecting what the heavens have in store for the dayâ€¦
2. *The last sip of coffee*â€¦ the one that I have after leaving the coffee on my desk for a while and suddenly realize I still have some more coffee left ðŸ™‚
3. *The gentle warmth of a bonfire*â€¦ on a lazy weekend night camp.
4. *The tight grip of a baby*â€¦ asking to stay by for a â€˜littleâ€™ longer.
5. *The cool breeze in a winter morning*â€¦ on a sweat stained body as I lay on the grass after some workout.
6. *The â€˜relaxingâ€™ massage of a waterfall*â€¦ after one of those tiring treks uphill.
7. *The melodious tunes of the self-trained musicians*â€¦ the birds in the wild, trying their best to wake me up early in the morning.
8. *The smile on the face of a loved one*â€¦ more so when you realize the reason behind it is me.
9. *The warmth in the hug of a friend*â€¦ when I feel down and hopeless, assuring me I am never alone.
10. *Laying down by the stream*â€¦ with my legs in the cold water, flowing down the slope, gently nudging me to give it way.
