*Ikigai* is the Japanese term for “the reason you wake up in the morning for”. The french have a similar term – *raison d’être* (pronounced something like “reason date”, with a french accent).

In my opinion, *ikigai* is not an abstract concept. Putting it as “the purpose or meaning of life” – makes it feel like an abstract concept and people have been trying to find the answer long since they learned to question things around them (personally, I do not know the progress we have made in this front). However, to me, *ikigai* is something profoundly intrinsic and something you choose for yourself. It is something that changes and grows with you. It gives you the sense of clarity, vision or perhaps a goal in life.

I was wondering, how many of us know what our *Ikigai* is – everyone has it, I am sure. But how many of us *know* what we want to live for, what drives us to wake up in the morning and do what we have to do to fulfill our *ikigai.* It drives you forward, motivates you and helps you grow. The pursuit of your *ikigai* gives you the sense of satisfaction and accomplishment – a sense of wholesome happiness.

Every religion has a similar concept – a quest to learn ones self. I feel that often the way it is depicted is quite complex, which makes it difficult for people to follow.

What I liked here is that for japanese, it is rather simple. Everyone has an Ikigai – and people try to follow it – it is something they choose for themselves – it can be as simple as “feeding one’s family” – doing his job, or just to see your loved ones happy. You don’t need to go on a quest to discover yourself, you don’t need to meditate for long hours. The difference is, once you KNOW your reason to wake up in the morning – you tend to enjoy what you do. THAT singular idea makes a whole lot of difference in one’s life.

I have always had my goals set clearly. Yeah, they changes and develop with time – but as I have said, for me, Ikigai as a localized concept is good enough. I know it’s time for me to take the right steps towards fulfilling it. :).
