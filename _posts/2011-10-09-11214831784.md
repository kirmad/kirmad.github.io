Back to Portrait after a long time. I was first practicing on the eyes. They are absolutely the most important part of a face – great eyes =&gt; 60% great portrait :)…!

Then I went ahead with the complete face. I used the same sheet cause I did not feel like wasting a whole sheet again… and it was practice anyways :)…!
