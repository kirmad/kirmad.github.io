It’s always fun to learn something new :)… and I have this habit of learning new things while creating gifts for my friends. *Shraddhvaani* – “Shraddha ki vaani” is my attempt at woodcrafts with laser 🙂 – something I learnt for my last birthday.

The initial idea was to create bookmarks with quotes from my friend (trust me, you’ll see a lot of them on facebook) – then I thought it would be better to create bookmarks which are similar to the *taalapatraalu* (palm leaf manuscripts) which were used to scribe the ancient texts in India. I wanted them to be as simple as possible. So, the design was simple and I used wood veneer from all across the world – from USA, Canada, Africa, Australia and of course India for engraving. One year’s worth of quotes 🙂

The hole on top is for using them as bookmarks – just add tassel :).

The next challenge was to carry them back to India safely… Hey, why not create a box for this :)…! The initial box design was simple – with a lid, but it was not cool enough. I had a few more ideas using living hinge technique, but then, I wanted it to be simple but serving the point. I did not want to use any hinges, screws or glue either. So, the simplest idea – sliding top box.

Now… when you create a box for something like this, you don’t want it plain. I wanted to have some designs engraved on the box – but what? You know what – these guys went to Gujarat just after I left for US, and I totally missed it :(… but hey, the folk designs in Gujarat are lovely. So, the designs were finalized :).

The naming was kind of obvious for me, Shraddha ki vaani, Shraddhvaani. No second thoughts 😛 – but the burn shadow for the text – nice touch eh? ;).

and then… something was missing. I wanted something to be a bit *hatke – a little bit of my branding.* Hence came the teddy bear :D… all the girls love it, but I had come across a teddy bear with all sorts of junk in it’s head. Well – totally relevant, don’t you think?!

PS: In the pics you will see glimpses of the second thing I worked on, the pencil lines and wood with post-its – practical and cool hand bag for ladies using a 1/8″ plywood :). I am altering the design a little to make it more appealing so, hopefully, will post it soon :D…!

Now for the finished product :)…!
